# Collative
Welcome to the club, reader. At Collative, we are trying to make high-end interconnected electronic systems, open, available, and repairable for all. As a collective (the name...), we are trying to create cheaper and more consumer-friendly electronics hardware; we are trying to diverge from the norm of unrepairable unfixable devices, tied to horrible corporations solely driven by profits. That changes here.
