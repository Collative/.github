# Collative
*/kəˈleɪtɪv/*

Welcome to the club, reader. At Collative, we are trying to make high-end interconnected electronic systems and software open, available, and repairable for all. As a collective (the name...), we are trying to create cheaper and more consumer-friendly electronic hardware and diverge from the norm of unrepairable, unfixable devices tied to horrible corporations solely driven by profits. That changes here.
